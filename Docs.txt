#this getting complex. I need to write this down
#*
Main Obj

anything hooking to the mainserver IPv6
client to client IPv4
anything else read the  program its not MC

******************************************************Def

"lo" is a reference to the ipaddress.

With the Ips I got ipv4/6 with the host server and the port connection at 52:
    main client server should hook up the the IPv6
    under da hood should be at IPv4

"ear" refers to the lister func#mainly server stuff but lowkey network:
        pass#ima need this space later

(1)URL is MainBackend.abc:53#this is the main host server(basically my operator)

"pawPrint" is a refer to the "postbox" and Soil_options
"Postbox" is where you can post and meant to be written on a dataserver and meant to call the ManeServ

**********************************************Configs

*ManeHosCon:
    earConfig is meant to be some type of listener method. gotta flush it some mo
    loConfig meant for theconnection handles
    Operator is meant to handle the switchboard and connections
    switchbord is helping the operators(like tha machine it would be more bulky)

*****************************************************************Socks its the freaking connnect crap

#socket = port + Ip... headache #*This a personal reminder*# two machine gotta share port numbers
*dont have a socket protocol yet but its a raw socket connect:
    hos Machines listen for a certain port... from a port package almost like a sec feature but its not,
    it would only accept a request for the package ifs the port keys match then#*in progress
Run the pipeline.Parser to read the package and send it to other ports and pipelines.
***************************************************************Port workers

*Echo:
    its proto 8 and its meant for IPv6 so remeber to set that...guess I should make a gui for that

*FileTransfer...InProgress

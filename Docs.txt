******************************************************Def

"lo" is a reference to the ipaddress.

With the Ips I got ipv4/6 with the host server and the port connection at 52:
    main client server should hook up the the IPv6
    under da hood should be at IPv4

"ear" refers to the lister func#mainly server stuff but lowkey network:
        pass#ima need this space later

(1)URL is MainBackend.abc:53#this is the main host server(basically my operator)

"pawPrint" is a refer to the "postbox" and Soil_options
"Postbox" is where you can post and meant to be written on a dataserver and meant to call the ManeServ

**********************************************Configs

*ManeHosCon:
    earConfig is meant to be some type of listener method. gotta flush it some mo
    loConfig meant for theconnection handles
    Operator is meant to handle the switchboard and connections
    switchbord is helping the operators(like tha machine it would be more bulky)

*****************************************************************Socks

keeping tabs on my socks right here
apparently sockets is like a lmph node where informations from top-level,skin-level, user-application level and take the information to hardware connections(Central Nervous System)
